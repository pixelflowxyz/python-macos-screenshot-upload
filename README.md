# python-macos-screenshot-upload
Upload screenshots taken using Screenshot.app to Backblaze B2

## Description

With no great alternative to [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) on macOS, I made the feature I was desperate for, with Python. As an added bonus, it still uses the native Screenshot.app by simply watching the screenshot folder.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* macOS
* `python3`
* `pip3`

### Installing

* Download the source from Github - `git clone` or the [Download](https://github.com/pixelflowxyz/python-macos-screenshot-upload/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) button
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Complete `config.yml` with the details from your device and your Backblaze account.
